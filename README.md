Lab Ex.13: Implement Mysql with Node.JS.

You are developing a Node.js application for a hotel reservation system. The application allows users to search for available rooms based on their preferences, such as check-in and check-out dates, room type, and occupancy. All room data is stored in a MySQL database.
Your task is to create a function that retrieves available rooms based on user input.

Using Node.js and the mysql module, describe how you would implement the backend functionality to retrieve available rooms from the MySQL database based on user input 
(check-in, check-out dates, room type, occupancy, etc.) for the hotel reservation system.Please provide code snippets and explain the steps involved in the process, including connecting to the database,
constructing the SQL query, handling the user's input, and presenting the available rooms to the user. Additionally, consider error handling and data validation to provide a reliable and user-friendly 
search feature
